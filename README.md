# Hi â€” I'm Bianca Braga ðŸ‘‹

I'm a curious Industrial Design student based in Seoul, South Korea. I explore the intersection of industrial design, electrical engineering, and code to create tangible, meaningful product experiences â€” especially Physical User Interfaces (PUI). Right now I'm building projects that connect product UX and physical computing.

## Next steps â€” what I can add for you
If you want, I can update the README with any of the following:
- Project entries with repo/demo links and 1-line descriptions  
- Portfolio / website link or embedded visuals  
- More detailed tool/language proficiency levels (beginner â†’ advanced)  
- Pronouns, a short CV, or a profile photo  
- Links to published write-ups, videos, or demos

Tell me which items above you want included (or paste links and short descriptions), and Iâ€™ll update the README accordingly.
