# Hi â€” I'm Bianca Braga ðŸŒ¿

I'm a curious Industrial Design student based in Seoul, South Korea. I explore the intersection of industrial design, electrical engineering, and code to create tangible, meaningful product experiences â€” especially Physical User Interfaces (PUI). Right now I'm building projects that connect product UX and physical computing.
